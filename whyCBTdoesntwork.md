CBT assumes that anxiety is generated internally and can be corrected internally.

That assumption works for nervous systems where:

- affect is primarily intrapsychic

- regulation is largely autonomous

- cognition reliably modulates arousal

For HCRNS, that assumption breaks.

### What CBT tries to do

CBT asks:

“What thought is creating this feeling?”

“Is that thought accurate?”

“What’s a more rational reframe?”

But HCRNS anxiety is often not thought-generated.

It’s field-generated.

It comes from:

- prolonged misattunement

- relational ambiguity

- emotional labor without reciprocity

- bracing against others’ states

- anticipatory regulation (“If I don’t track this, something will go wrong”)

There is no “cognitive distortion” to correct.

The nervous system is doing exactly what it was designed to do: track, prepare, hold.

### Why CBT can actually make HCRNS anxiety worse

When CBT fails for HCRNS, the client often concludes:

“I’m doing it wrong”

“I’m resistant”

“I’m not trying hard enough”

“I’m broken”

So they:

- double down on monitoring

- increase self-surveillance

- try to think their way out of a relational injury

That adds a second layer of dysregulation:

- primary: environmental mismatch

- secondary: self-invalidation

CBT accidentally trains HCRNS people to:

- **override bodily intelligence**

- distrust relational signals

- stay in misaligned environments longer

Which is why you see:

- persistent anxiety

- somatic symptoms

- health crashes

- “treatment-resistant” labels

Nothing is resistant. The treatment is misapplied.

### The key distinction CBT misses

CBT is good at:

“This fear is not accurate.”

HCRNS anxiety is often:

“This environment is not safe for this nervous system.”

That is not a belief error. That is information.

When HCRNS anxiety resolves, it’s usually because:

- relational load decreases

- reciprocity increases

- pacing slows

- attunement becomes mutual

- or the person exits the environment

To reiterate, the real interventions are:

- choosing fewer relationships

- tolerating loneliness instead of misattunement

- stepping out of roles that require constant regulation

- letting some things not work

- allowing delay, silence, and non-response

Those aren’t techniques. They’re existential decisions.

And they can’t be universalized.

*Many high co-regulation nervous systems experience anxiety that does not respond to CBT because the anxiety is not generated by distorted thinking, but by prolonged relational mismatch. Asking these systems to reframe rather than re-locate often deepens dysregulation and self-blame.*

That’s not anti-CBT. It’s contextualizing it.
