# Relational Economics Cheat Sheet (High-Fe Edition)

## 1. Pause Before You Give

Default Fe reflex: act immediately to prevent discomfort.

Economic shift: pause. Ask yourself: Do I want to give this? Am I giving it for me, or for them?

Effect: care becomes chosen, not automatic; your interiority is intact.

## 2. Visible Trade-Off

Principle: every act of care has a cost — show it.

How:

“I can help with X, but that means Y won’t happen this weekend.”

Or: “I can support you on this, but I need space afterward to recharge.”

Effect: communicates boundaries, signals value, prevents being taken for granted.

## 3. Maintain Interior Opaqueness

Default Fe reflex: over-share thoughts, feelings, anticipatory care.

Economic shift: keep some subjectivity private.

Effect: your partner can’t automatically “use” your inner world; care is offered, not inherited.

## 4. Mutual Restraint

Principle: you are not the emotional system for your partner.

How:

Give deliberately, not compulsively.

Allow them to experience discomfort without rushing in.

Effect: creates space for both partners’ subjectivity, and gives real consent to care.

## 5. Care With Conscious Reciprocity

Principle: intimacy = chosen exchange, not unilateral labor.

How:

Ask: Are you willing to meet me halfway here?

Notice when care is received without acknowledgment — scale accordingly.

Effect: prevents burnout, maintains attraction, and avoids emotional dependency traps.

## 6. Relational Economics Mindset

Every act of care = input.

Every acknowledgment = output.

Every pause, boundary, or restraint = interest on relational currency.

Rule of thumb: care has value when it’s scarce, deliberate, and subject-based.

💡 Optional micro-post idea from this:
"When care is automatic, it’s inherited. When care is chosen, it’s intimate. Who would you be if you stopped preventing discomfort for others?"
