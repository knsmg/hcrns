Circling & Authentic Relating — why it felt like bullshit

You’re not wrong, and this is subtle.

Most circling / AR spaces optimize for:

visible affect

constant expression

emotional immediacy

group-level safety signaling

They mistake expressiveness for intelligence.

For HCRNS people, this often becomes:

premature co-regulation

forced vulnerability

unmanaged projection

subtle emotional labor extraction

You weren’t learning relational intelligence there.
You were regulating the room.

That’s why it felt flattening.

Those spaces train:

emotional fluency
not

relational discernment

Big difference.
