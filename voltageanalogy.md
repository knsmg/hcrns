Your perception is high-voltage infrastructure.
You were running it through:

open circuits

live wires

uninsulated systems

constant access

Now you’re installing breakers.

That looks like:

seeing but not intervening

understanding but not translating

knowing without teaching

being moved without responding

That’s not hoarding.
That’s containment.
