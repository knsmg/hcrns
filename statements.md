- Fe makes you exquisitely capable of loving people who never have to grow to keep you.
- When Fe isn’t busy keeping everything running, it starts seeing how everything runs.
- Being deeply human in a dehumanizing system requires active refusal, not just self-knowledge.
- FJ differentiation requires a moment where Fe loses the ability to keep everyone safe at once.
- Fe doesn’t reorganize through instruction. It reorganizes through contrast + resonance. When the body finally feels the difference between flow and management, mutuality and labor, assessment and evaluation — it can’t un-feel it. Ti then comes in after to make language, not before to impose it.
