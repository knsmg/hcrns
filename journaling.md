Notice, don’t fix
Choose any prompt that draws you in. Answer slowly. Pause when something feels charged, heavy, relieved, or light.

Body & felt sense
* When I’m with someone and I’m assessing, what does my body feel like?
* When I’m evaluating, what changes in my body?
* What’s the emotional tone of assessment for me?
* What’s the emotional tone of evaluation?

Relationships I feel like I manage
* What am I subtly trying to prevent here?
* What outcome am I quietly working toward?
* If I stopped managing, what do I fear would happen?
* What might I be compensating for — their limits, their discomfort, their inconsistency, or my own hope?

Relationships that feel lighter or more reciprocal
* When I’m at ease with someone, what am I not tracking?
* What assumptions do I not feel responsible for correcting?
* What does “not doing much” actually feel like — neglect, relief, trust?
* If this person needed me suddenly, how would I respond?

Assessment vs. evaluation
* When I assess someone honestly, what am I noticing about them? (capacity, limits, values, emotional range, willingness)
* When I evaluate, what standard am I comparing them to?
* Where did I learn that this standard mattered?
* Which of my needs require assessment — and which turn into evaluation when I’m afraid?

Support & being met
* When I imagine reaching out for support, what do I already assume?
* How often do I pre-experience being misunderstood?
* How do I recognize empathy in my body?
* Has “imperfect empathy” ever still helped me regulate?

Integration
* Which relationships ask me to be more than I am?
* Which allow me to be exactly who I am, even when I’m imperfect?
* How can I tell the difference without trying to fix anything?
