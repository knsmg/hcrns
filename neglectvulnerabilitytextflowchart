[Orient: Scan relational field]
   ↓ detects others’ emotions, stress, needs
   ↓ nervous system absorbs/responds
   ↓ (risk if environment overwhelming → extra load accumulates)


[Differentiation: Locate boundaries]
   ↓ asks: "Where do I end? Where do others begin?"
   ↓ requires contrast, feedback, safe witness
   ↓ (risk if no contrast → blurred boundaries → Fe stunted)


[Respond / Express: Act, empathize, care]
   ↓ Fe needs external response to calibrate
   ↓ (risk if no recognition → overgiving, somatic tension, exhaustion)

[Orient] → [Differentiate fails] → [Respond continuously] → [Body accumulates stress] → [Fe stunted, selfhood underdeveloped]

[Collapse / Overload / Contrast] 
   ↓ forces differentiation
   ↓ safe witness / reciprocal feedback
   ↓ somatic insight emerges: "this is mine vs. theirs"
   ↓ Fe fully activated → relational clarity, playfulness, emotional ethics emerge
