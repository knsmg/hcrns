Most dominant psychological, productivity, therapeutic, and even “self-awareness” frameworks quietly assume a nervous system that is self-regulating first and relational second. They treat this configuration as human nature, not as a subtype.

Independence is framed as maturity. Emotional containment is framed as competence. Needing co-regulation is framed as weakness, pathology, or immaturity.

The problem is not that these assumptions are wrong.

The problem is that this “universal” baseline is parochial.

It belongs to certain nervous systems, not all — and yet it has been exported as law.

This universalization quietly reinforces nervous system hierarchies, consistently marginalizing what I refer to as *high co-regulation nervous systems*: systems that are relationally oriented by design, that register safety, clarity, and regulation through attunement rather than isolation.

Much of what follows resists conventional categorization. Not because it lacks rigor, but because its primary expression may be relational transmission, not publication.
