CBT assumes something very specific, usually unstated:

Anxiety is generated internally and can be corrected internally.

That assumption works for nervous systems where:

affect is primarily intrapsychic

regulation is largely autonomous

cognition reliably modulates arousal

For HCRNS, that assumption breaks.

What CBT tries to do

CBT asks:

“What thought is creating this feeling?”

“Is that thought accurate?”

“What’s a more rational reframe?”

But HCRNS anxiety is often not thought-generated.

It’s field-generated.

It comes from:

prolonged misattunement

relational ambiguity

emotional labor without reciprocity

bracing against others’ states

anticipatory regulation (“If I don’t track this, something will go wrong”)

There is no “cognitive distortion” to correct.

The nervous system is doing exactly what it was designed to do:
track, prepare, hold.

3. Why CBT can actually make HCRNS anxiety worse

This part is rarely named.

When CBT fails for HCRNS, the client often concludes:

“I’m doing it wrong”

“I’m resistant”

“I’m not trying hard enough”

“I’m broken”

So they:

double down on monitoring

increase self-surveillance

try to think their way out of a relational injury

That adds a second layer of dysregulation:

primary: environmental mismatch

secondary: self-invalidation

CBT accidentally trains HCRNS people to:

override bodily intelligence

distrust relational signals

stay in misaligned environments longer

Which is why you see:

persistent anxiety

somatic symptoms

health crashes

“treatment-resistant” labels

Nothing is resistant.
The treatment is misapplied.

4. The key distinction CBT misses

CBT is good at:

“This fear is not accurate.”

HCRNS anxiety is often:

“This environment is not safe for this nervous system.”

That is not a belief error.
That is information.

When HCRNS anxiety resolves, it’s usually because:

relational load decreases

reciprocity increases

pacing slows

attunement becomes mutual

or the person exits the environment

Not because they found the “right thought.”

5. Why this loops back to “not prescriptive”

If HCRNS said:

“When anxious, do X”
it would be lying.

Because the real interventions are:

choosing fewer relationships

tolerating loneliness instead of misattunement

stepping out of roles that require constant regulation

letting some things not work

allowing delay, silence, and non-response

Those aren’t techniques.
They’re existential decisions.

And they can’t be universalized.

6. A sentence you might want to write (or keep)

You could say:

Many high co-regulation nervous systems experience anxiety that does not respond to CBT because the anxiety is not generated by distorted thinking, but by prolonged relational mismatch. Asking these systems to reframe rather than re-locate often deepens dysregulation and self-blame.

That’s not anti-CBT.
It’s contextualizing it.
