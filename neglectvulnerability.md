HCR nervous systems are more vulnerable to emotional neglect

This is a real and under-named risk factor.

Neglect impacts HCRNS more severely because:

their baseline regulation assumes reciprocity

they detect absence more acutely

they internalize misattunement as self-failure

they stay engaged longer, hoping repair will come

For a self-regulating system, neglect is absence.
For HCRNS, neglect is ongoing dysregulation without relief.

That’s why you see:

health collapse

autoimmune patterns

exhaustion

anxiety that doesn’t respond to CBT

overdeveloped cognition compensating for unmet regulation

This isn’t fragility.
It’s design mismatch.
