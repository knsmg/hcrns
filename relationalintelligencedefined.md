# Relational intelligence defined


## A “relationally intelligent” person:

1. Can hold another person’s interiority without immediately centering themselves.

2. Can respond to needs and emotions without collapsing, reacting defensively, or withdrawing.

3. Can sustain emotional reciprocity — balancing giving, receiving, and witnessing.

4. Can tolerate ambiguous or complex relational cues without needing everything to be spelled out or simplified.

For a HCRNS folks, being around relationally intelligent people means your nervous system can relax, your body feels safe, and your emotional processing is supported. Without it, even minor interactions feel exhausting, confusing, or invalidating.
