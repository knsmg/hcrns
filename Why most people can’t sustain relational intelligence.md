Why most people can’t sustain relational intelligence (regardless of type)

This is not a moral failure. It’s a capacity + incentive mismatch.

Relational intelligence requires four things at once, long-term:

Stable self-regulation
(you can feel impact without outsourcing it)

Tolerance for mutual influence
(you don’t dominate, collapse, or dissociate when affected)

Delayed action
(you can pause instead of discharging immediately)

Non-extractive orientation
(you don’t unconsciously turn attunement into labor)

Most nervous systems can do one or two of these.
Very few can do all four consistently, especially under stress.

Now add society:

Capitalism rewards speed, decisiveness, clarity, independence

Social norms reward emotional self-containment

Most people are trained to minimize interdependence

So relational intelligence becomes:

inefficient

invisible

unrewarded

and threatening to identity structures built on autonomy

That’s why people visit relational intelligence but don’t live there.
