# What Relational Intelligence Is Not

## “Relationally intelligent” doesn’t mean “nice” or “emotionally expressive”

### Relational intelligence is not:

- talking about feelings a lot

- being empathic in a performative way

- being conflict-avoidant

- being warm, kind, or well-meaning

### Relational intelligence means the ability to:

- track mutual nervous system states in real time

- tolerate emotional influence without panicking or controlling

- distinguish responsibility from attunement

- stay present without managing, fixing, outsourcing, or collapsing

- let emotions move through the relationship rather than trying to contain them inside one person

Most people cannot do this for long.

Society is not relationally intelligent because it structurally rewards autonomy signaling, not co-regulation capacity.
