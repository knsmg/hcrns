Reflection 1 — De-pathologizing / clarity on Fe vs. Fi

Focus: You realizing that it wasn’t you who had a pattern, it was the system and the people around you projecting.

Lens: Cognitive / systemic, through the Fe/Fi/Te lens.

Emotion: Curiosity, relief, dawning awareness.

Key takeaway: Fe is structurally marginalized. People don’t misread you because of your flaws — they misread you because systems and frameworks don’t account for relational, systemic intelligence.

Reflection 2 — De-scapegoating / structural trauma

Focus: A deeper historical and systemic mapping of how childhood emotional neglect and power dynamics played out in your life.

Lens: Relational, historical, ethical.

Emotion: Exhaustion, grief, maybe anger — the feeling of “I was always the one carrying everything.”

Key takeaway: You were made the identified patient repeatedly, and much of your suffering came from others’ unprocessed neglect, not your own deficits. It’s a macro-level view of why the first reflection’s insights were necessary.

Reflection 3 — De-authorizing / methodology critique

Focus: You rejecting the Enneagram as a reliable system for yourself.

Lens: Analytical, epistemic, procedural.

Emotion: Frustration, amusement, intellectual discernment.

Key takeaway: Enneagram works for Fi-based identity processing, not Fe-based relational systems. You can see it, evaluate it, even use it as shorthand, but it doesn’t define or explain you.
